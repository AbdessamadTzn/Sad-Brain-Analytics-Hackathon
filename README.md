Our project focuses on analyzing mental health factors among professionals and students in India. By leveraging real-world datasets, we trained a predictive model with **98.76% accuracy** to assess mental health risks based on various lifestyle and work-study-related factors. The goal is to gain deeper insights into the **impact of work pressure, academic stress, and personal habits** on mental well-being.
